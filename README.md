# sflow_analysis
Analysis and visualisation of SFlow data done as a school project.

networkGraph.html is an interactive visualisation of every node in the sflow data done using pyvis. It may be quite laggy to use, due to the sheer number of nodes involved.  

This repository also features my analysis notebook, as well as the submitted report, which is additionalanalysis.pdf. Overall, it was pretty fun to mess around with the data and ways to visualize it.
